#   Delivery Statistics Data Tracker Project

A WIP tracker for collecting and organizing personal data from gigs like Uber Eats and door dash

##  Why?

As a student, my schedule has been a bit hectic, so I picked up Uber Eats as a part time gig

The thought occurred to me, that it should be possible to make a program that helps me optimize what times and areas I should be working, so I can reduce downtime and be more efficient with my time.

## The Goal

My current goal is to be able to be able to collect all trips and details from them in a way that can be accessed and read by other programs, and can be read by humans

My progress on this program is going to be split in three parts

- The Data Collection API:
    This involves creating a set of functions that allow me to add, remove, and manipulate data from my trips. I do not have access to any API's that would allow me to automate this, so it will be all manual in the meantime

- Data Proccessing:
    Using data collected from the previous part, and analyzing it in such a way to recognize patterns, and return real information on what times, locations, and dates would be optimal to be work in

- The GUI:
    The final part that would tie the previous two together in a way that is user friendly and easy to work with. 

## Progress

Currently, most of my progress has been made on the first part, data collection. I have working functions that allow me to collect data and add it into a JSON string. Once basic editing functionalities are done, I will move onto data analytics and processing. Testing will be done on my own data from my own trips that I have collected over time.
